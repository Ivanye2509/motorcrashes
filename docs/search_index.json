[["index.html", "NYC Motor Vehicle Crashes Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " NYC Motor Vehicle Crashes Analysis Maxwell Zhou, Xin Ye, and Kiranmai Vasireddy 2021-12-12 Chapter 1 Introduction A motor vehicle accident can have a large number of factors that lead to it. We can study a large sample of these accidents that occur in New York City and try to further understand any patterns in the data. Factors such as the location of the accident, the time at which the accident occurs, and other contributing factors (vehicle types involved in the accident, the reason for the occurrence of the accident, etc.) can help us understand and visualize the causes and effects of these accidents in greater depth. This information can be of great insight to drivers, motorists, pedestrians, and even police officers. First, it helps the normal people by allowing them to be more cautious while driving around accident prone areas during certain time periods. Second, it would help police officers in two ways - to help them in protecting the safety of the pedestrians and other people in the area by monitoring the contributing factors of the accident in the accident prone locations at a particular time and also, to manage their manpower well (more police officers can be put to work at accident prone areas compared to the other areas). This is the driving factor behind the project that we aim to work on: to study the pattern of motor vehicle accidents that take place in New York City to help understand and organize resources to reduce accidents. Besides, our study could help the public to be aware of the most deadly accidents caused by different vehicle types and contributing factors and potentially reduce the occurrence of those accidents. With this study, we try to answer the following questions: How does the time of day and the day of the week impact the total number of accidents that occur and number of people injured or killed in those accidents? Which are some contributing factors and vehicle types that contribute to most accidents? Among all the contributing factors or vehicle types, which are more likely to cause deaths rather than injuries in these accidents? Is there any obvious geographic information of the accidents recorded by mistakes in 2020 in New York? And are there any patterns on the distribution of those accidents in New York in 2020? What are the top 15 streets in each New York City borough by number of people injured and killed? Are there any patterns in the most dangerous streets? What contributing factors cause the most numbers of people injured and killed in accidents? By analyzing this dataset in depth, we can help to answer the questions above. The answers to those questions will allow the streets of New York City to be a safer place for everyone.

It is owned by NYC Open Data and is provided by the New York Police Department(NYPD). The dataset is a table where each row of the table represents a crash event. It contains the information from all the police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. In cases where someone is injured or killed, or a damage worth $1000 a police report is required - MV104-AN.The dataset is subjected to change where there is any update in the police report (MV104-AN) with the revised crash details.It was created in April, 2014 and is a large dataset with 1.84Million entries and 29 columns. 2.1 Why and how is it collected? The police department implemented TrafficStat using the CompStats model to work towards the safety of people and to maintain uniformity in which data related to motor vehicles is collected. Initially, they used a TAMS- Traffic Management Systems to collect traffic data using a few details around the collision, but later on when they decided to work towards the Vision Zero- to ensure zero fatalities, the MV-104AN form was filled in a much more detailed manner for all the vehicle collisions that occured. The TAMS model was eliminated and FORMS - Finest Online Records Management System was introduced in 2016 to store data electronically. The policemen use a department cellphone or computer to enter all the MV-104AN data fields which are stored in the Department crime data warehouse. This ensures that the entire MV-104AN form with all the details is stored securely, which can be used to do a detailed traffic safety analysis to work towards the Vision Zero goal. 2.2 The data we would work on: Since the dataset is enormous, we have decided to work on a complete year of data, starting from 1, January 2020 to 31, December 2020. This data contains 112890 entries.Studying the recent year of data gives a clear understanding of the latest trends in the collisions, given the growth of traffic every year. 2.3 Problems/Issues: The missing values of various columns have been mentioned in the Missing chapter of this book(Chapter 4). The dataset is very large(1.8 million rows) as it contains data over various years, so its difficult to use R to visualize and transform the data, we take more about this in the Cleaning chapter of this book(Chapter 3). 2.4 A brief overview of the dataset: Dataset contains 29 attributes, a brief overview of all these are described below: Table 2.1: DATASET DESCRIPTION Column Name Description of column Crash Date Date of collision Crash Time Time of collision Borough Place of collision Zip Code Postal code where the collision occurred Latitude Latitude on Coordinate System Longitude Longitude on Global Coordinate System Location Latitude , Longitude pair On Street Name Street on which collision occurred Cross Street Name Nearest cross Street where collision occurred.

Therefore, we save this cleaned data set as a new csv file in our resources folder. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values This is our missing values plot on the entire cleaned 2020 motor vehicle crashes data set. We can see that our dataset contains many different columns (29 columns) and a plethora of missing values across the majority of the columns. Because we have so many columns and rows (112,890 rows), this leads us to have an extremely large amount of missing patterns that appear in our dataset. As a result, it is very hard to see individual rows and columns in our missing data plot because of how great the number of different missing patterns are. The plot below shows the same missing patterns plot, but only including the most frequently appearing missing patterns and also removing the columns that do not have any missing values. This way, we can further examine the missing patterns that appear more commonly in our dataset. Now that we have only selected the columns containing missing values (we already know that all of the columns removed have no missing values at all) and the missing patterns in our dataset that appear more frequently, we can observe many different patterns in the missing values of our dataset. For example, we have currently selected the top 15 missing patterns because these are the missing patterns with over 1000 missing rows. We observe that the 4 features with the highest percentages of missing rows have all of the top 15 missing patterns. ## number_of_features_missing count percentage_missing ## 1 7 28309 25.07662326 ## 2 10 25781 22.83727522 ## 3 8 20253 17.94047303 ## 4 9 15704 13.91088670 ## 5 12 6920 6.12986093 ## 6 11 4347 3.85065108 ## 7 13 3094 2.74072106 ## 8 5 2472 2.18974223 ## 9 6 2441 2.16228187 ## 10 15 849 0.75205953 ## 11 14 795 0.70422535 ## 12 4 748 0.66259190 ## 13 3 632 0.55983701 ## 14 1 296 0.26220214 ## 15 2 232 0.20550979 ## 16 16 12 0.01062982 ## 17 17 5 0.00442909 ## feature_name num_of_missing percentage_missing ## 1 VTC5 112065 99.2692001 ## 2 CFV5 112037 99.2443972 ## 3 VTC4 110106 97.5338825 ## 4 CFV4 109980 97.4222695 ## 5 VTC3 102794 91.0567809 ## 6 CFV3 102183 90.5155461 ## 7 OFFSN 83436 73.9091151 ## 8 CRSN 59616 52.8089290 ## 9 ZIP 39229 34.7497564 ## 10 BOR 39221 34.7426699 ## 11 VTC2 34120 30.2241120 ## 12 ONSN 29454 26.0908849 ## 13 CFV2 24618 21.8070688 ## 14 LAT 8921 7.9023829 ## 15 LONG 8921 7.9023829 ## 16 LOC 8921 7.9023829 ## 17 VTC1 1073 0.9504828 ## 18 CFV1 513 0.4544247 ## 19 Date 0 0.0000000 ## 20 Time 0 0.0000000 ## 21 X.PI 0 0.0000000 ## 22 X.PK 0 0.0000000 ## 23 X.PEDI 0 0.0000000 ## 24 X.PEDK 0 0.0000000 ## 25 X.CI 0 0.0000000 ## 26 X.CK 0 0.0000000 ## 27 X.MI 0 0.0000000 ## 28 X.MK 0 0.0000000 We can see from these two tables that various rows and columns have less and more missing values. For example, we can see that the vehicle type codes and contributing factor vehicles 3-5 have the most rows missing for those columns because many accidents recorded are between 2 cars or 1 car. For the rows, we can see that the majority of rows have between 7 - 10 columns of missing values per row. Fewer rows have very little or very many missing values. In this missing values plot, we can observe the relationship between the missingness of certain rows and the type of the column that the data is missing from. For example, we can see that most of the integer columns have no missing values, except for the zip code column, in which much of those are missing. We can also see missing patterns among the rows as well. For example, we can see that most of the integer columns have no missing values, except for the zip code column, in which much of those are missing. We can also see missing patterns among the rows as well. Besides, all rows that have either latitude, longitude, or location missing also have the other two variables missing, which means those rows are able to be not geographically visualized on a map. However, it seems that the majority of the crashes have the geographic features that suggesting we can later visualize these crashes on the map.

The above plot shows a small multiples plot of the frequency that crashes occurred during each hour of the day. Each facet shows those frequency counts for one day out of the week. We observe that the frequency of crashes over the day follows the same distribution across all days of the week. Additionally, for each day of the week, the hour with the most crashes is colored blue, while the hour with the least crashes is colored red. For all of the weekdays, time periods that very early in the morning (1 - 5 AM) have very low numbers of crashes, with the the least amount of crashes occurring either at 3 or 4 AM. On weekend mornings, number of crashes is much higher at those early morning time periods compared to the weekdays, and the hour of least crashes occurring later in the morning (5 AM on Saturday and 7 AM on Sunday). Some likely explanations for these trends across early morning crashes are: first, there are less people are driving during the early morning during weekdays because of work/school the next day. Second, there are more people driving during the early mornings of the weekends because many people do not have work/school then. Additionally, as people consume more alcohol and are less aware during the nights before these weekend periods, more crashes occur as people are driving home during the early morning. On the other hand, the period with the largest amount of crashes during the weekdays are from 2 - 6 PM, with the highest amount of crashes during 4 or 6 PM. On weekends, the period with the largest amount of crashes is between 2 - 4 PM, with the highest amount of crashes at 2 PM. The explanation for these high crashes hours are that this time period during the weekdays are usually rush hour, the times when the majority of the people return home from work. With the high volume of traffic, most crashes are bound to occur. As less people drive around on the weekend, there are less crashes during the day in general compared to the weekdays. The above graphs show the casualties and fatalities that result from crashes faceted the type of casualty or fatality. Each facet shows the total number of crashes that resulted in that outcome for each hour in the day. We can observe from the injury row that cyclists and pedestrians are injured far less than than the motorist involved in accidents. This is probably because the majority of the crashes occur between two or more vehicles and without cyclists or pedestrians involved. We can see the same trend of early mornings have far less crashes relatively and that the number of crashes of all types in the injuries row increase steady until the afternoon/evening time. From the row with deaths, we can see the cyclist deaths are far more sporadic and fewer than both motorist and pedestrian deaths. This may be because crashes involving cyclists have less impact because of the bike or other reasons. We can also see that there are far more motorist deaths late at night and early morning. This may be a result of more people driving under the influence of alcohol during those time periods, while during the day, more people will be working and not driving. We can also see that pedestrians also have a high number of deaths throughout the day, almost as high as the motorist deaths. This is interesting because from the injuries row, the ratio of pedestrian to motorist injuries is far lower. However for deaths, the ratio is higher. This may be because in crashes involving motorist, although the number of those crashes is higher, they also have more safety measures, such as seat belts and airbags, to prevent death, while crashes involving pedestrians have a higher chance of being fatal. The above graph shows the change in the number of total crashes, number of people injured, and number of people killed in crashes over all of the 2020. We can observe that for the total number of crashes and people injured, these values decreased greatly starting in mid-March and decreasing until mid-April before slowly increasing again. This trend is likely due to the impact of COVID-19, as the city shutdown and advised people to no leave their houses. As a result, many people either left the state or stayed at home, both of which decreased the number of people who drove very greatly. An interesting observation is that the decrease in total crashes is proportional to the decrease in number of people injured, which is logical. During the pre-shutdown months (January - March), total crashes averaged at levels around 450 and dropped to around 150 at the bottom. For injuries, it started at around 150 and dropped to around 50. Both of these show a 300% decrease in crashes during the same time period. However, we can also notice that the pandemic does not really have any effect on the number of deaths. For the entire year, both pre-shutdown and post-shutdown, the majority of days ranged between 0 - 5 deaths. A likely explanation for this is that deaths are quite rare during all periods of time, and less people driving does not contribute to less deaths. 5.2 Impact of Vehicle Types and Contributing Factors on Crashes at Different Locations The second question comes to: Which are some contributing factors and vehicle types that contribute to most accidents? Above is a Cleveland dot plot showing number of vehicle collisions caused by different Vehicle types in different boroughs. We can see that all boroughs have almost the same rankings for type of vehicles that causes the vehicle collisions. Obviously, Sedan, SUV, Taxi, Pick-up Truck and Box Truck are the top five types of vehicles that causes the collisions in 2020, which accounts for more than 80% of the total vehicle collisions. The above cleveland dot plot different Contributing factors ranked by number of vehicle collisions in different boroughs, we can see that most accidents in 2020 are primarily caused by Driver Inattention by in each borough. Among all, Brooklyn have the biggest number of accidents caused by Driver Inattention. And Queens has almost the same number of accidents caused by Driver Inattention as well. Next come the contributing factor of Following too closely(6.72%), Failure to yield right-of-way. Then, we tried to answer the following question: Among all the contributing factors or vehicle types, which are more likely to cause deaths rather than injuries in these accidents? We did a null hypothesis test on using H0: p = 0.006 and Ha: p  0.006 using the significance level of 0.05, which is the average possibility of the death ratio in 2020, and categorized the vehicle types into severe, neutral, and mild to rank the severity of the vehicles collisions based on its possibility of resulting in death rather than just injuries in the accidents. Then we plot the categorized data and their label on a log-transformed graph in order to zoom in for those vehicle types have relative small sample size comparing to those have very large sample sizes. From the above scatter plot, we can see that some of the vehicle types that would are more likely to lead to death rather than just injury are Motorcycle, Concrete Mixer, Flat Rack, Fork lift, etc. On the Contrary, vehicle types that are less likely to cause deaths rather than injuries are Station Wagon/Sport Utility Van. We also did the same null hypothesis test on the death ratio by different contribution factors and rank the severity of the vehicles collisions based on their possibilities of resulting in death rather than injuries. We also did the same log transformation when ploting the scatter plots. From the above scatter plot, we can see that the top three most severe vehicle collision contributing factors that are more likely to lead to death are Unsafe speed, Traffic Control Disregarded, and Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion. On the Contrary, those factors that are less likely to cause deaths rather than injuries are following too closely, failure to yield right-of-way, and driver inattention/distraction. 5.3 Impact of Geographic Locations on the Number of Accidents and Deaths Then, we tried to answer the following two questions: Is there any obvious geographic information of the accidents recorded by mistakes in 2020 in New York? And are there any patterns on the distribution of those accidents in New York in 2020? In order to see whether any data points has been mistakenly recorded as well as observing whether the missing values for borough would have any geographical patterns, we plot the location of vehicle collisions on the map after removing all location with longitude and latitude with the magnitude of 0 since those collisions would be otherwise happened on the Null Island. And the reason why we plotted them by facet instead of only color categories was that the missing values patterns may be possibly overlapped by other points, which makes it harder to obverse. Meanwhile, it would be better for determing whether there are mistakenly coded positions for each borough. From the above map, we can see that the borough for all vehicle collisions seem to be recorded correctly. For the missing value plots, we can clearly see a large number of those collisions seems to be happened on the intersection of boroughs or on the boundary of the island while there are also some other points that are evenly distributed on the map, which means we may probably drop those NA values from geographic perspectives. The first plot above shows the density of vehicle collisions happened in New York in 2020. We can see that the most accident occurred most frequently at Bronx Boroughs while the Staten Island seems to have the least accidents occurred in 2020. The second plot shows the density of vehicle collisions that caused death in New York in 2020 with actually locations of those collisions shown as dots on the heatmap. We can see that it has almost the same distribution as the first heatmap, which occurred most frequently at Bronx Boroughs and least frequently at Staten Island. 5.4 Impact of Contributing Factors and Vehicle Type on People Injured Which contributing factors affect each of the vehicles the most, based on the number of people injured in the accidents? This plot - Heatmap gives an indication of contributing factor with respect to each vehicle type which result in the most number of injury cases in the New York City. We can observe from the graph that in case of Sedan as the vehicle type, most of the number of injured cases have taken place (approx 5600) when the driver was inattentive, followed by failure yield right of way(approx 2089), and Following to closely. With this insight, the police can make sure that when they are inspecting a Sedan on accident, they can check if the driver in the seat is attentive or not. Also,We observe that for all types of vehicles, Driver inattentiveness is a major factor for the injury of the person on road (cyclist, motorist or pedestrian). Another observation we notice is that most of the contributing factors of the injury is for the vehicle Sedan. After Sedan, Ports Utility Vehicle shows the maximum number of injury cases for the same 3 reasons that the sedan has shown. So keeping a check on those three factors of accidents can help reduce the number of injuries in the accidents. 5.5 Impact of Street Locations On Number of People Injured Which of the top 15 streets in each of the Boroughs in New York have the maximum number of injured cases? This is plot which shows the top 15 streets in each borough where maximum number of people have got injured compared to the other streets and avenues in that borough. From the plot we can observe that in Bronx and Brooklyn there are more number of people getting injured compared to the other parts of New York, namely the Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island. Staten Island has the least number of injury cases. On inspecting the plot, we can notice that in Bronx - Bruckner Boulevard is the street where most number of injury cases come from, in case of Brooklyn its the Atlantic Avenue, for Manhattan, 2nd Avenue shows the maximum number of injury cases with over 110 injuries, for Queens, Queens Boulevard shows the maximum number of injury cases for the entire Queens Borough, and finally in Staten Island, Hylan Boulevard has the maximum number of injury cases with over 100 injuries. It can also be noticed that in Staten Island, this is the only street having such high number of accidents, so if additional preventive measures are taken, then this number can be brought down. Keeping a check on these streets in each of the borough, can drastically reduce the number of injuries in the accidents overall in the city of New York. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Our interactive bar plot presents our data in an animated format that allows the user to gain insights that would be hard to visualize using static graphs. The plot takes in data that is generated from our 2020 motor vehicle crashes dataset and investigates the relationship between time of day and the number of crashes that happen during those hours. It also allows user to freely switch between a single day of the week and the total for the entire year by clicking the buttons at the top of the page. After clicking the button, the bar and axes dynamically shift to represent the new days data values and the user is able to how the relative distribution of number of crashes changes from day to day for each hour. For example, we can see that there are relatively more crashes in the early morning hours on Sundays than on Mondays. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion This project has been a great source of learning, formulation, and application of ideas and thoughts to a real-world problem. A few limitations, future directions, and lessons learned are mentioned below. One of the limitations that we have faced while working on this dataset is that the dataset is large, so we had to refine our analysis of accidents in the city of New York to one full year of data, namely 2020. The reason for choosing to study a full year of data is that we wanted to understand how traffic and accidents are affected by different months of the year. For this reason, we could not analyze the latest year - 2021 (January to December), which would not have been possible with 2021. As part of the future directions, we want to analyze multiple years data and compare different years data amongst other years, this would help analyze the growth in traffic and accident rate in New York over a range of multiple years. This would also be instrumental in studying the accident patterns and traffic growth before and after Covid 2020. Thus, analyzing a COVID-19 data set along with this data set could be a great start for the next stage. From a technical standpoint, we want to incorporate more graphs, namely Alluvial diagrams, Mosaic plots to study the underlying patterns in the data in a better manner. While working on this project, we have learned how to use the techniques and graphs learned in class on a bigger, impactful real-world dataset that has the potential to help the community. It helped us study the trends in the number of accidents in New York city based on different boroughs. We also observed how accidents can be affected by the time of the day, which can be used by the police to understand the areas and contributing factors for accidents more in depth, contributing towards the improvement of the public safety on the streets in New York. Finally, we have also learned how to work more effectively as a team, discuss ideas openly, and incorporate those ideas and suggestions into a project.
