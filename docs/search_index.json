We can see that our dataset contains many different columns (29 columns) and a plethora of missing values across the majority of the columns. Because we have so many columns and very many rows (112,890 rows), this leads to us having an extremely large amount of missing patterns that appear in our dataset. Because it is hard to see individual rows and columns in our missing data plot because of how great the number of different missing patterns are, the plot below shows the same missing patterns plot, but only including the most frequently appearing missing patterns and also removing the columns that do not have any missing values. This way, we can further examine the missing patterns that appear more commonly in our dataset. Now that we have only selected the columns containing missing values (we already know that all of the columns removed have no missing values at all) and the missing patterns in our dataset that appear more frequently, we can observe many different patterns in the missing values of our dataset. ## na_rows count ## 1 17 5 ## 2 16 12 ## 3 15 849 ## 4 14 795 ## 5 13 3094 ## 6 12 6920 ## 7 11 4347 ## 8 10 25781 ## 9 9 15704 ## 10 8 20253 ## 11 7 28309 ## 12 6 2441 ## 13 5 2472 ## 14 4 748 ## 15 3 632 ## 16 2 232 ## 17 1 296 ## # A tibble: 30 × 2 ## na_cols count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 VEHICLE.TYPE.CODE.5 112065 ## 2 CONTRIBUTING.FACTOR.VEHICLE.5 112037 ## 3 VEHICLE.TYPE.CODE.4 110106 ## 4 CONTRIBUTING.FACTOR.VEHICLE.4 109980 ## 5 VEHICLE.TYPE.CODE.3 102794 ## 6 CONTRIBUTING.FACTOR.VEHICLE.3 102183 ## 7 OFF.STREET.NAME 83436 ## 8 CROSS.STREET.NAME 59616 ## 9 ZIP.CODE 39229 ## 10 BOROUGH 39221 ## # … with 20 more rows We can see from these two tables that In this missing values plot, we can observe the relationship between the missingness of certain rows and the type of the column that the data is missing from. For example, we can see that most of the integer columns have no missing values, except for the zip code column, in which much of those are missing. We can also see missing patterns among the rows as well. For example, we can see that most of the integer columns have no missing values, except for the zip code column, in which much of those are missing. We can also see missing patterns among the rows as well. For example, all rows that have latitude, longitude, or location missing also have the other two variables missing.
