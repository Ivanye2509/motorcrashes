# Data sources

The dataset chosen for this study is taken from the NYC Open Data. It is owned by NYC Open Data and is provided by the New York Police Department(NYPD). The dataset is a table where each row of the table represents a crash event. It contains the information from all the police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC.  In cases where someone is injured or killed, or a damage worth $1000 a police report is required - MV104-AN.  The dataset is subjected to change where there is any update in the police report  (MV104-AN) with the revised crash details.  It was created in April, 2014 and is a large dataset with 1.84Million entries and 29 columns.

## Why and how is it collected?

The police department implemented TrafficStat using the CompStats model to work towards the safety of people and to maintain uniformity in which data related to motor vehicles  is collected. Initially, they used a TAMS- Traffic Management Systems to collect traffic data using a few details around the collision, but later on when they decided to work towards the Vision Zero- to ensure zero fatalities,  the MV-104AN form was filled in a much more detailed manner for all the vehicle collisions that occured. The TAMS model was eliminated and FORMS - Finest Online Records Management System was introduced in 2016 to store data electronically. The policemen use a department cellphone or computer to enter all the MV-104AN data fields which are stored in the Department crime data warehouse. This ensures that the entire MV-104AN form with all the details is stored securely, which can be used to do a detailed traffic safety analysis to work towards the Vision Zero goal.

## The data we would work on:

Since the dataset is enormous, we have decided to work on a  complete year of data, starting from 1, January 2020 to 31, December 2020. This data contains 112890 entries.Studying the recent year of data gives a clear understanding of the latest trends in the collisions, given the growth of traffic every year.

## Problems/Issues:

The missing values of various columns have been mentioned in the Missing chapter of this book(Chapter 4). The dataset is very large(1.8 million rows) as it contains data over various years, so its difficult to use R to visualize and transform the data, we take more about this in the Cleaning chapter of this book(Chapter 3).


## A brief overview of the dataset:
Dataset contains 29 attributes, a brief overview of all these are described below:
