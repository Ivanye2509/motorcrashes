## NYC Motor Vehcile Crashes Analysis

Our dataset is obtained from data provided by the city of New York. The data contains details about each motor vehicle crash event that occurs in New York City, with each row representing one crash event. When someone is injured or killed in a crash, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage in that crash, a police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions. Our data comes from all police reported motor vehicle collisions that meet these conditions, provided by the New York Police Department (NYPD).
This dataset has 1.83 million rows and 29 columns. Some columns that stand out and seem important include: crash date, crash time, borough, location, number of people injured, number of people killed, contributing factors of vehicles, and vehicle type. Additionally, because our dataset is extremely large and contains information on 1.83 million crashes between 7/1/2012 and 10/9/2021, we are planning on focusing on the crashes in 2021 year to date, which contains 84711 crash entries. This will allow R to be able to process the data in a reasonable amount of time and we will also be able to see the trend in car accidents during the most recent year.
